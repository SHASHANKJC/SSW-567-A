# Challenges Encountered:

Inclusion of a hint to introduce bugs adds an interesting aspect.
Learning curve for beginners with automated testing tools.
Structuring test cases appropriately requires understanding.
Cover all triangle types: equilateral, isosceles, scalene, and right-angled.
Include cases with valid and invalid inputs for robust testing.
Ensure correct identification of each triangle type and graceful handling of invalid inputs.
Include edge cases and scenarios that may break the program.
Successful execution of all tests builds confidence in implementation correctness.
