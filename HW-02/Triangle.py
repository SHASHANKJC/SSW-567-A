The primary goal of this file is to demonstrate a simple python program to classify triangles

    Your correct code goes here...  Fix the faulty logic below until the code passes all of 
    you test cases. 
    
    This function returns a string with the type of triangle from three integer values
    corresponding to the lengths of the three sides of the Triangle.
    
    return:
        If all three sides are equal, return 'Equilateral'
        If exactly one pair of sides are equal, return 'Isosceles'
        If no pair of  sides are equal, return 'Scalene'
        If not a valid triangle, then return 'NotATriangle'
        If the sum of any two sides equals the square of the third side, then return 'Right'
